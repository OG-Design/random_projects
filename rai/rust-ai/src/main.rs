    - ownership is a set of rules that govern how a rust program manages memory. 
    All programs have to manage the way they use a computer's memory while running.
    In rust memory is managed through a system of ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks.
    If any of the rules are violated, the program won't compile. None of the features of ownership will slow down your program
